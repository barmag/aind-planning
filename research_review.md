# Research Review
In this report we explore three advancements in the field of planning highlighting the impact on the field of AI as a whole. We explore STRIPS; the first major planning system. Followed by Partial Order Planning, which dominated the research for 20 years. We finish by exploring Planning Graphs, which is orders of magnitude faster than partial order planning.
### STRIPS [1]
STRIPS (STanford Institute Problem Solver) was the first major planning system implemented in collaboration with SRI as the planning component for the Shakey robot project at SRI [2]. In STRIPS the world model is represented as by a set of first-order well-formed formulas. Operators(actions) are described with preconditions both positive and negative, and side effects as a set of add and delete lists [1]. The algorithmic approach for finding the plan was based on GPS (General Problem Solver).
The major infeluence of STRIPS to both planning, and AI generally was its representation language, which is close to "classical" language [2].
